to connect postgresql using C++ i used pqxxlib 
if u explore a bit u will get idea about downloading library 
then u just use a basic connection program just use chatgpt for that 
and u need to compile everything using correct path ...these only took me 2 days on my macbook...
know some reserved keywords from pqxx library like pqxx::nontransaction pqxx::work , pqxx::result , pqxx::connection , exec_params etc..before diving into code
